    <h2><b>About me</b></h2>
        <br>
            <p>My name is Ben Kernot, I am eighteen years old from Waterford, Ireland. I am currently studying a BSc in Applied Computing (Common Entry) in Waterford Institute of Technology. I live at home with my Mum and Dad, as my sister is currently studying General Nursing in Edinburgh since the beginning of September. I went to secondary school at where I completed my Leaving Cert exams.
    <br>
            <p> Since I was young I've always had an interest in technology, software and gaming. My first ever device was given to me by my dad and it was his gameboy from when he was younger which was atleast 25 years old. I grew up playing all kinds of games such as Spyro, Crash Bandicoot and Super Mario while playing on different devices ranging from the Wii to Playstation to Xbox to eventually building a Computer which I still use today.</p>
        <br>
            <p>I am enjoying the Applied Computing course for the most part but I struggle with certain modules such as Maths and Physics. My favourite modules are Web Development and Computer Systems. After year one I think I would like to pursue the Forensics route.</p>
