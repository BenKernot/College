    <h2><b>My Family</b></h2>
        <br>
            <p>I was born and raised in Waterford, Ireland by my Mum, Lorraine who is a solicitor and my Dad, Ray who is a full time Electrician. I have sister named Hannah who is 3 years older me and is currently studying General Nursing in Edinburgh. I have a Grandad named Tom who I see often, he enjoys golfing and watching sports on TV. My Dad is English so I have family in parts of England but mainly in London, I go over there usually twice a year to visit them.</p>

        <h3>My Friends</h3>
        <br>
            <p> Outside of school I like to go out with my girlfriend Emma and my friends. We like to spend time together by going out, partying, watching movies and spending time together etc. It is hard to find time for all of us to be together as some people are still in secondary school in their final exam year. I originally got introduced to my group of friends through my good friend Bryan who is also apart of the Applied Computing Course. My oldest friend of 15 years is also in the Applied computing course I met him back in 2004.</p>
